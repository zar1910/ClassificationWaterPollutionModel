# Water Pollution Classification - Data Modelling Project

This is a university project for the Data Modelling class (IS411).  
We built a classification model using a dataset of water pollution in China.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict pollution levels using classification models based on various water quality features.

Models used in this project:
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

Dataset:
The dataset contains water pollution metrics from various sources in China, with labeled pollution levels as the target variable.
